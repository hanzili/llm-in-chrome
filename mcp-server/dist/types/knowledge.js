/**
 * Knowledge Types
 *
 * Site knowledge is stored as Markdown files - human-readable notes that
 * both LLMs and humans can easily read and write.
 *
 * Key design principle: The knowledge is GUIDANCE, not INSTRUCTIONS.
 * The agent figures out the actual selectors and interactions.
 *
 * Distinction from Mem0:
 * - Knowledge Base: HOW to navigate a site (workflows, tips, quirks)
 * - Mem0: WHAT info to use (user data, preferences, task context)
