/**
 * LLM in Chrome MCP Server
 *
 * A browser automation agent as a service. Instead of exposing low-level
 * browser primitives (click, type, navigate), this exposes high-level
 * task-based tools. The agent handles all browser interaction autonomously.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Parallel task execution (each task has a session ID)
 * - Multi-turn interaction (send follow-up messages)
 * - Real-time status monitoring
 * - No need to understand browser internals
 *
 * Use this when you need to:
 * - Fill out web forms
 * - Navigate complex websites
 * - Extract data from web pages
 * - Perform multi-step web workflows
