*Task: Submit LLM in Chrome to DevHunt*

**Required Information:**
- GitHub or Google account credentials: Needed to authenticate via OAuth and access the submission form.
- Product name: Official name of the LLM tool you’re submitting.
- Product description: Clear summary of what the LLM does and why developers should care.
- Product category: Appropriate DevHunt category (e.g., AI, DevOps) for your submission.
- Product assets: Any required visuals (logo, screenshots) or links demanded by the submission form (e.g., website URL, repository link).

**Optional Information:**
- Additional media or supporting links: Videos, tutorials, or documentation links that aren’t marked as required but enhance the listing.

**Steps:**
1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to devhunt.org.
2. Click the login button and authenticate using either GitHub or Google OAuth when prompted.
3. Once logged in, find and select the option to submit a new product/tool.
4. Fill in all required fields, including product name, description, category, and any mandatory assets such as logos or URLs.
5. Provide optional supplementary media or information if available to strengthen the submission.
6. Review the submission for accuracy, ensuring all required fields are completed and assets uploaded.
7. Submit the form and wait for confirmation or further instructions from DevHunt.

**Tips:**
- Ensure you have all necessary product assets ready before starting; DevHunt may not allow saving drafts midway.
- Authentication relies on GitHub or Google, so confirm you can access at least one of those accounts in Chrome.
- Pay attention to category selection; choosing the wrong category could reduce visibility or halt approval.

### submit-llm-chrome

**Required Information:**
- Tool logo: Square image file (~220×220 px minimum) uploaded via "Select an image" file picker
- Tool name: Short text field for the product name
- Catchy slogan 😎: Short text field for tagline
- Tool website URL: Valid URL to the product website
- Quick Description: Rich-text field (HTML supported) describing the tool
- Tool pricing type: Radio button selection - exactly one of: Free / Subscription / One time fee

- Tool categories: Tag/chip input field - type category names and press Enter to add multiple tags
- Demo video link: URL field accepting YouTube or direct MP4 links
- ProductHunt import: Auto-fill button to import existing ProductHunt listing data

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to https://devhunt.org/account/tools/new and sign in to load the "Launch a tool" form
2. In "Tell us about your tool" section: If you have an existing ProductHunt listing, click "Import" button to auto-fill fields (optional, do this FIRST to avoid overwriting manual entries)
3. Upload tool logo by clicking "Select an image" and choosing a square image file (~220×220 px)
4. Fill in Tool name, Catchy slogan, and Tool website URL text fields
5. Optionally fill GitHub repo URL field
6. Fill Quick Description textarea (HTML formatting is supported)
7. In "Extra Stuff" section: Select exactly one Tool pricing type radio button (Free, Subscription, or One time fee)
8. Optionally add Tool categories by typing category names in the chip input and pressing Enter after each
9. In "Media" section: Optionally add Demo video link URL (YouTube or MP4)
10. Upload at least three screenshots via "Upload" button; first uploaded image automatically becomes the cover image; drag to reorder images after upload if needed
11. In "Launch Week for Your Dev Tool" section: Open the "Launch week" dropdown and select a week slot (view available slots, costs, and date ranges; type month name to filter long list)
12. **STOP HERE** - Do NOT click the submit button (small circular button with "X" icon at top-right of form badge overlay)

**Tips:**
- The actual submit button is hidden/non-obvious: it appears as a small circular button with an "X" icon at the top-right of the form (attached to badge overlay), not as a traditional submit button below the form
- Submit button remains disabled until all required fields are complete, especially the three-screenshot minimum
- No autosave exists - keep your content saved externally in case of session timeout
- ProductHunt import will overwrite existing field values, so use it before manual data entry
- Logo and screenshots must be square to prevent distortion; uploads accept drag-and-drop but file picker is more reliable
- Launch week dropdown is long; typing the starting month filters options; free slots only appear for mid-2027 and beyond dates
- Floating note indicates you can edit tool info or reschedule launch after submission, but payment
