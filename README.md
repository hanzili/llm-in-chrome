## What is LLM in Chrome?

**LLM in Chrome** is a Chrome extension that brings autonomous AI agents to your browser. Unlike traditional browser automation tools that require scripting or recording, our extension understands what you want to do and figures out how to do it—just like a human would.

Simply describe your task in plain English, and watch as the AI navigates websites, fills forms, extracts information, and completes multi-step workflows on your behalf.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🗣️ Natural Language Control** - Tell the AI what you need in plain English
- **👁️ Visual Understanding** - The AI can see and understand web pages like you do
- **🤖 Autonomous Actions** - Clicks, types, navigates, and scrolls automatically
- **🔄 Multi-Step Workflows** - Handles complex tasks across multiple pages
- **🎯 Domain Intelligence** - Built-in knowledge for popular sites (Gmail, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- **🧩 Multi-Modal** - Supports text + image inputs for better context
- **⚡ Real-Time Streaming** - See the AI's thought process as it works
- **🔐 Privacy First** - Runs locally, your data never leaves your machine
